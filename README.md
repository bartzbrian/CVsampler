Working on a arduino based eurorack module, posting the code here. It takes two inputs, one any audio or CV, one a trigger. while holding the record button down, the module records the input from the audio/cv jack via an envelope follower, with the pot acting as an offset, into a buffer of up to six seconds. Once recorded, this CV buffer is then output from the out jack, either once per trigger, or looping continuously if the cycle toggle button is pushed. A second output acts as a dedicated envelope follower for the audio/cv input. If both buttons are held down simultaneously, recording begins with the next trigger.
